  [🔎]Every Dart File Is a Library:
     In Dart, every file (including its parts) is considered a library, even if it doesn’t explicitly use a library directive1.
     Libraries allow you to organize and encapsulate code, making it easier to manage and reuse.

  [🔎]Flutter Apps and Dart Files:
     When you create a Flutter app, you write Dart code to define the app’s behavior, UI, and logic.
    These Dart files are compiled and packaged into binary files (such as .apk for Android or .ipa for iOS) that are uploaded to app stores

❓What is scaffold ?
   =Scaffold is a top-level container for a Flutter application. It provides a basic material design visual layout

❓What is AppBar ?
   =AppBar is a horizontal bar that is typically displayed at the top of an app screen. 

❓What is pubspec.yml ?
  =pubspec.yaml is a file that contains metadata about your Flutter project.
